The course will cover programming techniques utilized in functional programming languages as well as the coordination of multiple executing threads.
The examples are the techniques that include recursive definitions, non-mutable data structures, higher order functions, and closures. 
Upon completing the course, students will be able to implement recursion, pattern matching, and non-mutable data structures in a functional programming language. Higher-graded students will also be able to utilize higher order functions, explain functional programming basics, evaluate functions with respect to time complexity, and utilize message-based multi-threaded programming.

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `rith` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:rith, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
